rgpd.title = RGPD
rgpd.subtitle1 = The implications of the RGPD for business
rgpd.subtitle2 = Why such a regulation?
rgpd.text1 = The DPMR stands for "General Data Protection Regulation", also known as GDPR or "General Data Protection Regulation". It was adopted in April 2016 and entered into force on 25 May 2018. Its purpose is to protect the individual and his or her personal data (i.e. "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person" [GDPR, Chapter 1, Article 4]) against processing of such data by companies, institutions and any other body.
rgpd.text2 = "Privacy by default and by design": any person who processes personal data must automatically guarantee the highest level of data protection, right from the design of the technology used to collect it. Register of processing activities : The keeping of a register is mandatory for companies with 250 or more employees, those that regularly process personal data, those that process sensitive data (data on racial or ethnic origin) and those that carry out processing operations that may pose a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. For others, it is also advisable to keep one to protect oneself in the event of control by the competent authorities, but there is no obligation to do so. In the event of a breach of CPOs (for example, if the database is hacked), organisations have an obligation to inform data subjects of the situation. They must also review all their contractual processes. Finally, it is strongly recommended that organisations appoint a DPO (Data Protection Officer) who will, among other things, be responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the GDPR. He will also ensure that the company is compliant.
rgpd.text3 = Nowadays, the web is an integral part of our lives: we buy online, we share on social networks, etc. As a result, our personal data is increasingly exposed and less and less protected. To counter this, the EU wanted to put in place new rules that would give citizens more control over their data. The aim was also to create a sense of trust between businesses and EU citizens, so that the latter would feel more reassured about using digital tools.
